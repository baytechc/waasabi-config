# Waasabi configurator

Commandline tool for creating, managing and deploying customized [Waasabi](https://waasabi.org) instances from scratch.

## How to use

Make sure you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer. You can also also create/configure Waasabi instances within containers, WSL (Windows SubSystem for Linux), virtual machines or right on a server/VPS you would like Waasabi to be deployed on.

Start the Waasabi configurator with the `npx waasabi` command.

This will download the latest version of the configurator and launch the setup interface.

Follow the instructions to generate a new configuration, and deploy the newly configured instance however you prefer.
